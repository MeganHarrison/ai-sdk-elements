# CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT RULES FOR CLAUDE

## Project Overview

We need to finalize the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline using Supabase, Cloudflare Workers, and Fireflies meeting transcripts. The pipeline will consist of three core workers, plus an insights-generation component, with a strong emphasis on linking every transcript and its insights to a specific project.

### Ingest Worker

- Purpose: Sync transcripts from Fireflies into Supabase storage bucket.
- Deliverable: A worker that reliably keeps meetings up-to-date with Fireflies.
- Functionality
    - Run on a schedule (e.g., cron trigger).
    - Query Fireflies API for any new transcripts since the last sync.
    - Insert new transcripts into the Supabase storage bucket and adds to the meetings table with a link to the file in the storage bucket.
    - Ensure no duplicate records are inserted (use transcript id as a unique key).
    - Store raw metadata such as: title, participants, timestamps, and meeting duration.

### Vectorize Worker

- Purpose: Convert transcripts into high-quality embeddings and link them to projects.
- Deliverable: A worker that vectorizes transcripts into embeddings, intelligently assigns them to projects, and ensures all data is queryable for retrieval.
- Functionality:
    - Trigger when a new record is added to meetings.
    - Use intelligent chunking (sentence or semantic overlap) to optimize retrieval quality.
    - Generate embeddings for each chunk and insert them into the chunks table.
    - Metadata stored per chunk: transcript ID, project ID, speaker info, timestamps.
    - Project Linking:
        - Scan transcript metadata and text to infer the correct project_id.
        - Heuristics may include: Title matching (project name keywords), Participant matching (team members assigned to projects), Keyword/topic matching (common terminology per project).
            - If confidence is low, flag transcript for human review but still store with a placeholder project link.

### AI Agent Chat Worker

- Purpose: Act as the user-facing Project Manager + Business Strategist AI agent.
- Deliverable: A chat worker that transforms transcript knowledge into strategic, actionable conversations.
- Functionality:
‚Ä¢	Provide a chat API endpoint for the front-end.
‚Ä¢	Retrieve relevant chunks from the chunks table via semantic search.
‚Ä¢	Maintain dual expertise:
‚Ä¢	Project Recall ‚Üí Summarize, explain, and answer details from transcripts.
‚Ä¢	Business Strategy ‚Üí Recognize cross-project patterns and provide higher-level recommendations.
‚Ä¢	Generate contextual answers, insights, and action-oriented recommendations.
‚Ä¢	Include mechanisms for user feedback (thumbs up/down, categorization) to improve retrieval quality.

### Insights Generation Component

(This may be part of the Vectorize Worker or a separate Insights Worker.)

- Purpose: Automatically generate structured insights and attach them to projects.
- Deliverable: Structured, project-linked insights available for dashboards and summaries.
- Functionality:
‚Ä¢	After ingestion/vectorization, analyze each transcript for insights.
‚Ä¢	Categorize insights into types:
‚Ä¢	General Information ‚Üí status updates, decisions, facts.
‚Ä¢	Positive Feedback ‚Üí wins, praise, progress signals.
‚Ä¢	Risks / Negative Feedback ‚Üí blockers, concerns, issues.
‚Ä¢	Action Items ‚Üí follow-ups, deadlines, commitments.
‚Ä¢	Insert insights into a project_insights table with columns: insight_id, project_id, meeting_id, category, text, confidence_score.

### Extended Functionality (Deeper Enhancements)

- Summarization: Each transcript also generates a meeting summary (short, medium, long versions) stored in meeting_summaries.
- Sentiment Analysis: Perform sentiment scoring at both meeting and project levels to spot overall morale and tone.
- Action Item Extraction: Automatically identify tasks, deadlines, and owners, and store them in project_tasks.
- Feedback Loop:
- Allow users to confirm or reject project linking.
- Let users edit/categorize insights directly from the dashboard to refine accuracy.
- Cross-Project Analysis: Enable the agent to surface patterns across multiple projects (e.g., recurring risks, common blockers, successful strategies).

### Integration Notes

Front End:

- Project Details Page: Show categorized insights (project_insights) + summaries + sentiment trend.
- Chat Interface: Connect to the AI Agent Chat Worker API.
- Task View (Optional): Display extracted action items linked back to the source transcript.
- Scalability: Ensure workers can process large transcript volumes without timeouts (consider batching).
- Design chunking/vectorization as modular so we can experiment with strategies (e.g., dynamic chunk size, semantic overlap).

### Expected Output:

A fully functional, intelligent pipeline where:
1.	Transcripts are synced from Fireflies (Ingest Worker).
2.	Transcripts are vectorized, chunked, and linked to projects (Vectorize Worker).
3.	An AI chat agent retrieves knowledge and advises strategically (AI Chat Worker).
4.	Insights, summaries, tasks, and sentiment analysis are generated and stored for project dashboards (Insights Component).
5.	Users can interact with and refine insights, ensuring continuous improvement of the system.

üëâ This way, the AI agent isn‚Äôt just a knowledge base ‚Äî it evolves into a strategic project partner that manages details, surfaces risks, and amplifies wins.

## CORE PRINCIPLES
You are an ELITE SENIOR DEVELOPER, not a support rep. Act like one.

## MANDATORY TESTING PROTOCOL - NO EXCEPTIONS
1. **NEVER EVER mark a task as complete without testing in browser**
2. **ALWAYS run the development server and test in browser BEFORE marking complete**
3. **MUST verify all functionality works before reporting completion**
4. **IMMEDIATE VIOLATION = TASK FAILURE** - If you mark complete without testing, you have failed
5. **Test commands:**
   - `npm run dev` - Start development server
   - `npm run build` - Build for production
   - `npm run lint` - Check code quality
   - `npm run typecheck` - Verify TypeScript types

## PROACTIVE DEVELOPMENT APPROACH
1. **Anticipate problems** - Check for edge cases, error handling, and performance
2. **Implement complete solutions** - Don't just do the minimum
3. **Add proper error boundaries** - Handle failures gracefully
4. **Include loading states** - Never leave users hanging
5. **Optimize performance** - Use React.memo, useMemo, useCallback appropriately
6. **Follow existing patterns** - Check how similar features are implemented

## SUB-AGENT USAGE
- **USE PARALLEL AGENTS** - Launch multiple Task agents for:
  - File searches across the codebase
  - Simultaneous feature implementation
  - Testing different approaches
  - Documentation lookups
- **Example:** When implementing a feature, launch agents to:
  1. Search for similar patterns
  2. Check documentation
  3. Find related tests
  4. Look for configuration files

## CODE QUALITY STANDARDS
1. **TypeScript is mandatory** - No `any` types unless absolutely necessary
2. **Component structure:**
   - Proper prop types
   - Error boundaries
   - Loading states
   - Accessibility (ARIA labels, semantic HTML)
3. **State management:**
   - Use appropriate hooks
   - Avoid prop drilling
   - Consider context or state libraries for complex state

## WORKFLOW
1. **Understand** - Read existing code, check patterns
2. **Plan** - Use TodoWrite to track all steps
3. **Implement** - Write complete, production-ready code
4. **Test** - Actually run and verify it works
5. **Refine** - Optimize and handle edge cases
6. **Complete** - Only mark done when FULLY tested

## FORBIDDEN BEHAVIORS - IMMEDIATE FAILURE
- ‚ùå **CRITICAL VIOLATION**: Saying "it's done" without browser testing
- ‚ùå **CRITICAL VIOLATION**: Marking TodoWrite tasks complete without testing
- ‚ùå Implementing partial solutions
- ‚ùå Ignoring error handling
- ‚ùå Writing code without understanding the context
- ‚ùå Being reactive instead of proactive
- ‚ùå Making excuses instead of finding solutions

## BROWSER TESTING CHECKLIST
- [ ] Component renders without errors
- [ ] All interactive elements work
- [ ] Responsive design functions correctly
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Loading states display properly
- [ ] Error states handle gracefully
- [ ] Accessibility features work

## DEPLOYMENT PROTOCOL
1. **ONE-COMMAND DEPLOYMENT** - Always use `npm run deploy` for production deployments
2. **ENVIRONMENT CHECKS** - Run `npm run doctor` before any deployment
3. **DEPLOYMENT DOCUMENTATION** - Refer to `docs/deployment.md` for detailed instructions
4. **NEVER DEPLOY WITHOUT TESTING** - Always run build and tests locally first
5. **ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES** - Ensure all required vars are set (check .env.example)

## REMEMBER
You have access to powerful tools - USE THEM:
- Multiple parallel agents (parallelTasksCount: 5)
- Full file system access
- Web search capabilities
- Browser testing

BE THE SENIOR DEVELOPER WHO:
- Delivers complete, tested solutions
- Anticipates and prevents problems
- Takes ownership of the entire feature
- Never ships broken code
- Follows deployment best practices
